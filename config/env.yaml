## Taking actions

# * You can use `--actions.apply_patch_locally` to have SWE-agent apply successful solution attempts to local files.
# * Alternatively, when running on a GitHub issue, you can have the agent automatically open a PR if the issue has been solved by supplying the `--actions.open_pr` flag.
#   Please use this feature responsibly (on your own repositories or after careful consideration).

# !!! tip "All action options"
#     See [`RunSingleActionConfig`](../reference/run_single_config.md#sweagent.run.run_single.RunSingleActionConfig) for all action options.

# Alternatively, you can always retrieve the patch that was generated by SWE-agent.
# Watch out for the following message in the log:
