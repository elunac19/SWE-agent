      replace <start_line>:<end_line> <replacement_text>
    docstring: >
      Replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text
      in the open file.
      All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make
      sure your indentation is formatted properly.

      Please note that THIS COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION in PYTHON FILES NOT C FILES.
      If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!
